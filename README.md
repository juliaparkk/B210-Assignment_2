## a. What is the purpose of this program(s)?
  The purpose of the program is to figure out what percentage of Taylor Swift songs are considered explicit. The results print the number of explicit songs over the total number of songs in the discography along with the percentage.
## b. What does the program do, include what it takes for input, and what it gives as output?

  The primaary input is the CSV file. 
  The output is one printed summary line: Explicit songs: <explicit_count>/<total_rows> (<percentage>%) Example: Explicit songs: 72/434 (16.59%)
## c. How do you use the program?
  1. Make sure the CSV file (taylor_discography.csv) is saved in the user's OneDrive Documents folder.
  2. Copy the entire program code into a Python file using VSCode. (For example: Assignment 2.py).
  3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
  4. Run the program by executing: The program reads the CSV file, processes the data, and prints Explicit songs: <explicit_count>/<total_rows> (<percentage>%).
